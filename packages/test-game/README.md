# Test Game

## Brainstorming

Characteristics
- Minimalistic
    - Graphics minimal: limited to basic ascii characters
    - Gameplay minimal: Very simple mechanics
- Casual
    - No enemies? 
- Can stop anytime -> Turn-based, no time-critical actions

Intended Experience
- Empty black space, explore
- Similar to ThreeBodyProblem game in the book, seemingly empty but a lot of hidden complexity
- Can build something, a sense of progress

Game Goal
- to... explore, build and create?
